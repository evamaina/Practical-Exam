	
	To demonstrate the use of MVC pattern in Angular I created a simple todo app attached on the repo as MVC with Angular.
	Below is the explanation of how I achieve MVC in the todo app. 	

	MVC 

	Model 
	The model contains the business logic of the application.
	I used TodoService class to act as the model, it hold all the 
	CRUD operations which in our case is the business logic  	

	View 
	User interface of the application.
	I used HTML component to display todo contents. It's the interface that the user will be interacting with it.

	Controller
	Feeds the view with the data from model.
	I used observer to update the views with the changes made to todo array list either insertion or deletion
